### **üñ•Ô∏è Usage Guide**

This project simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms and computes energy consumption based on the selected algorithm. It calculates turnaround time (TAT), waiting time (WT), response time (RT), and provides an energy savings calculation.

## Step 1: Select a Scheduling Algorithm

Choose one of the following scheduling algorithms:
- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
- **RR (Round Robin)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **MLQ (Multilevel Queue)**
- **MLFQ (Multilevel Feedback Queue)**

## Step 2: Input Process Data

You need to input the following details for each process:
- **Arrival Time**: The time when the process arrives in the system.
- **Burst Time**: The time the process requires on the CPU.
- **Priority**: Only applicable for **Priority**, **MLFQ**, and **MLQ** algorithms.
- **Time Quantum**: Only used for **Round Robin** scheduling (time slice each process gets).

## Step 3: Compute Scheduling

Once the process data is entered, the system computes:
- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: The total time taken from the arrival of the process to its completion.
- **Waiting Time (WT)**: The total time the process spends waiting in the ready queue.
- **Response Time (RT)**: The time between the submission of a request and the first response.
- A **Gantt Chart** displaying the execution order of processes and time slices.

## Step 4: View Energy Consumption

The system calculates power consumption based on CPU frequency scaling:

### Baseline Power Consumption:

P<sub>baseline</sub>= C * V<sup>2</sup> * f<sub>max</sub>

Where:
-  C = Capacitance (fixed),
-  V = Voltage (depends on frequency),
- f<sub>max</sub> = Maximum CPU frequency.

### Optimized Power Consumption (with Dynamic Voltage & Frequency Scaling):

P<sub>new</sub> = C * V<sup>2</sup> * f<sub>opt</sub>

Where f_opt and V_opt are chosen based on scheduling optimizations.

### Power Savings Calculation:

Power Savings =(P<sub>baseline</sub> - P<sub>new</sub>) * 100 / P<sub>baseline</sub>
